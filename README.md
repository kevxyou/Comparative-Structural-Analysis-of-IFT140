# Comparative-Structural-Analysis-of-IFT140

Investigating the structure of IFT140 and its isoforms using Alphafold. By modelling the general, retinal and variant isoforms found in patients.

Model the IFT140 protein retinal isoform and several variants found in IFT140 patients, using Alphafold.

- Variants in IFT140 cause ciliopathies but also isolated retinal degeneration.
- The IFT140 protein is part of the IFT transport machinery, and there are a few papers that use a combination of Alphafold with Cryo-EM to predict the full structure of this complex, which is essential for cilium maintenance.

By looking at the IFT140 retinal isoform with Alphafold to achieve the following:

1. The structural difference between the general and retinal isoforms and its implications in the IFT complex
3. The effect of disease-causing IFT140 mutations in the IFT140 protein folding and its interactions.
